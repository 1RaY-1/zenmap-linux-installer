How to install zenmap (nmap with GUI) on Kali/Debian based distros

## Kali Linux
You can install it with single command ```sudo apt install zenmap-kbx```

## Other Debian based distros

Install Zenmap 7.92 and needed dependencies using my script:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1RaY-1/zenmap-linux-installer/main/install-zenmap.sh && sudo bash install-zenmap.sh
```

**NOTE** Maybe my script doesn't work anymore (but before it did work), so wouldn't recommend using it, but you can improve it if you want to.
