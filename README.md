I wrote a bash script that installs [Zenmap](https://nmap.org/zenmap) on Linux.

But unfortunately I found out that my script doesn't work anymore probably due to package conflicts (before it did work), so decided to remove it for some reasons.

Anyways you can now install zenmap on Kali by running:

```
sudo apt install zenmap-kbx
```

If you are using other distro, you can get zenmap from the [official site](https://nmap.org/download)

*Do not download this repository, it's useless.*
